# Umbraco.GridLocker

Installing this packages will make ALL grids on your site locked down for everyone apart from Administrators.

What does this mean? All non-admin users will be able to edit the content that is already on place in the grids, but they won't be able to add new items, re-order items, delete items, or add new rows.

At the moment this package is a very blunt tool, I would like to improve it to make it more configurable and to allow it to target specific grids. If anyone who's an Angular ninja fancies giving me a hand with this (my Angular skillz are far from l33t at the moment), please get in touch :)
