# Umbraco.GridLocker

Installing this packages will give you a new property editor. This editor will lock the grid on the contenttype you've added. By default only the admin is able to edit the grid completely. You are able to set the allowed users.

What does this mean? All limited users will be able to edit the content that is already on place in the grids, but they won't be able to add new items, re-order items, delete items, or add new rows.
